         *Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)* for the classification of gene
         expression in human diseases, specifically targetting cancer
         and heart disease (subject to change based on project
         constraints). It is designed as a *skill-enhancement project*,
         aimed to deepen my understanding and proficiency in
         bioinformatics and data visualization.''')

         project will not only contribute to the understanding of
         disease-specific gene expression patterns but also serve as
         a platform for practicing advanced computational techniques.
         The development of an interactive Streamlit application to
         showcase these insights underscores the project's emphasis
         on practical application and learning, ultimately aiming to
         bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and real-world
         bioinformatics challenges.''')
