### This personal project is centered on harnessing the power of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for the classification of gene expression in human diseases, specifically targeting cancer and heart disease. It is designed as a skill-enhancement endeavor, aiming to deepen my understanding and proficiency in bioinformatics and data visualization. By working with real-world RNA-Seq or proteomic data, the project will not only contribute to the understanding of disease-specific gene expression patterns but also serve as a platform for mastering advanced computational techniques. The development of an interactive Streamlit application to showcase these insights underscores the project's emphasis on practical application and learning, ultimately aiming to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and real-world bioinformatics challenges.
